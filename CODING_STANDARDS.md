# Repository Coding Standards

The purpose of the Coding Standards is to create a baseline for collaboration and review within various aspects of our open source project and community, from core code to themes to plugins.

Coding standards help avoid common coding errors, improve the readability of code, and simplify modification. They ensure that files within the project appear as if they were created by a single common unit.

Following the standards means anyone will be able to understand a section of code and modify it, if needed, without regard to when it was written or by whom.

If you are planning to contribute, you need to familiarize yourself with these standards, as any code you submit will need to comply with them.
