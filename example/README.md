# BeaconSDK - Example App

This app demonstrates how to use the `BeaconSDK`. 

## Run the app

> To run this app you need an UseCaseApi client (see [Preconditions][1]). 

Create a new properties file called `beacon_sdk_prod.properties` in the `root` directory of the example app by copying 
the existing [`beacon_sdk.properties`][2]. Add your client information to the newly created properties file. Select 
the `prod` build variant and run the example app.
